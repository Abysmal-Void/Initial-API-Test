Im not a software engineer, I kept going through trial and error, 
fine tuning a code script and interaction sequence between a gpt, 
an HTTP-API endpoint, then finaly the code writen within a vs code domain. 
At the beginning, there was zero knowledge of coding, programing, 
or script language understanding. Because of the usefulness of AI,
I was provided the opportunity of learning software engineering
along the way. I have nowhere near enough requirements to be labeled 
as a software engineer, however I now understand how to create one of 
these sequences. The main use for this specific gpt was purely so I 
didnt have to search for templates of legal documents manually. 
The next gpt will be one that uses the database generated from
this script in order to file legal documents for users and provide 
a downloadable link for them to be able to manipulate the Information
that they inputted. 

If there are any software engineers that would be interested in Assisting 
the development of any future gpts I create, please contact me with this email 
(solomonivpro@gmail.com). The primary extent of the assistance you would provide 
would be along the lines of assuring the integrated code spat out from the AI 
"works." The engineer will be entitled to 10% of any profit made from any gpt 
they assist in creating, despite the extent of their influence. Have a fantastic 
day, God Bless.
